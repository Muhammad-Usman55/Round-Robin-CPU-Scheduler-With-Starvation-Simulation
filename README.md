# Round Robin CPU Scheduler with Starvation Simulation

This project implements a CPU scheduler using the **Round Robin algorithm** in C++. It also includes enhancements like **dynamic time quantum adjustment** and **starvation simulation** for late-arriving processes. This simulation is suitable for Operating Systems course assignments and demonstrations.
